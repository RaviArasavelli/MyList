# Fix GitHub Pages 404 Error

## Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub

Run these commands:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/RaviArasavelli/mylist-todo-app`
2. Click on **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select: **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Click **Save**

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Actions

1. In the same repository, go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, select: **"Read and write permissions"**
3. Check: **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
4. Click **Save**

## Step 4: Trigger Deployment

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. If it's not running, click on it and click **"Run workflow"**
4. Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)

## Step 5: Access Your Site

After deployment completes, your site will be available at:
- `https://raviarasavelli.github.io/mylist-todo-app/`

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get 404:

1. **Check Actions tab** - Make sure the workflow ran successfully
2. **Check Pages settings** - Make sure source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. **Wait a few minutes** - GitHub Pages can take 1-2 minutes to update
4. **Clear browser cache** - Try incognito/private window

### If workflow fails:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on the failed workflow
3. Check the error message
4. Common issues:
   - Repository not found (make sure repo exists)
   - Permissions issue (enable Actions permissions)
   - Branch name (should be `main` not `master`)

## Alternative: Manual Deploy

If GitHub Actions doesn't work:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select: **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Branch: **main**
4. Folder: **/public**
5. Click **Save**

## ⚠️ Remember

GitHub Pages only serves static files. The backend API won't work. For full functionality, use **Vercel** instead (see DEPLOYMENT.md).
